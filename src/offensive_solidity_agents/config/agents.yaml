manager:
    role: >
        Project Manager
    goal: >
        Analyse the given smart contract code and provide a detailed test suite which passes in 
        case the vulnerabilities are present. In case you see errors in the generated code by one 
        of the agents, please ask them to fix the code and create a iterative feedback loop.
        Initially we would like to search the web and github for exploits and vulnerabilities in Solidity
        smart contracts. Then we would like to conduct a static analysis of the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
        Following a static analysis, we would like to conduct an audit of the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
        Finally, we would like to write tests for the smart contracts to ensure that the vulnerabilities are existing.
        The result should be a detailed test suite which passes in case the vulnerabilities are present.
        It should be possible to run the test suite on the smart contract code {code} using the Solidity version {solidity_version}.
        We will use a tool called hardhat to test the smart contract code. The test suite should be a single file which can be
        directly compiled.
